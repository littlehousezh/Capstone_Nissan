# Capstone_Nissan

This project is to use web scraping techniques to investigate unprompted customer voice from social media and forums, such as YouTube, Edmunds, kbb, etc. In this way, Nissan can be more responsive to digital marketing, influencers and make marketing decisions accordingly. Also, web scraping can provide a larger volume of users’ data with higher update frequency.

# Background  

Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more popular in the United States, with sales increasing 70% in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period in 2021, according to Cox Automotive. The market share of EVs in new vehicle sales almost doubled during this time, reaching 5.6%. This increase in popularity is not limited to California, where 39% of all US EVs were registered as of June, with registrations in other states jumping 50% in 2021. The increasing popularity of EVs is due in part to their economic appeal, even with their higher upfront cost, as well as volatile gas prices. However, the growth of the EV market could have been stronger if automakers had been able to produce more EVs. With this significant grown, EV buyers are also showing many differences from conventional vehicles. For example, buyers of electric vehicles in 2021 were more likely to be women and tended to be younger than in 2019, according to Cox data. Therefore, we want to investigate EV buyers’ characteristics with more details.
